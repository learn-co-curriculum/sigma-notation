Sometimes you will see parentheses used as in above, and other times you will see brackets used to describe a sequence like {1, 6, 11, 16, 21}.  A sequence is just an ordered list of numbers.  So just as a list in Python is an ordered list of elements, our sequence is the same thing where each element is a number.  To describe the components of a sequence, we can use the word **element**, or we can also use the word **term**.  So in our sequence above, 1 is a term, as is 6 and 21."
